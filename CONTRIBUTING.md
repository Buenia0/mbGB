## Reporting Issues

If you find any issues with libmbGB, report them [here](https://github.com/Buenia0/libmbGB/issues).

## Contributing

libmbGB is a brand-new project, so there currently is a great opportunity to keep things clean and well-organized early on.
As such, coding style is very important when making commits.

### General rules

* Make sure to fork the official repoistory before making any commits.
* Do not, under any circumstances, introduce new dependencies or platform-specific code into the core library.
* Use namespaces often.
* Once you are done making any commits, submit the forked repository as a pull request.
